								<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="3" data-line-end="4">October is a month of gorgeous fall weather, costumes, pumpkins and a burst of vibrant color as nature sunsets into winter. While candy corn and haunted houses may come to mind, most people don’t realize that October is also Ohio Archeology month.</p>
								<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="5" data-line-end="6">Movie blockbusters have helped perpetuate the stereotype that archeology is simply about digging stuff up or hunting for treasure. The Indiana Jones movies, although they are entertaining, shift viewers’ focus to glittery artifacts in momentous temples rather than the organic and inorganic clues real archeologists often excavate from the ground. Other films like Jurassic Park use the terms archeology and paleontology interchangeably, furthering this confusion as to what the subject actually encompasses.</p>
								<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="7" data-line-end="8">Dr. Joseph Gingerich, Director of the Field School and Assistant Professor of Anthropology at Ohio University, is able to clear up the confusion about archeology.</p>
								<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="9" data-line-end="10">“Archeology has nothing to do with dinosaurs,” he clarifies.</p>
								<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="11" data-line-end="12">According to him, archeologists like himself focus on, “Studying humans through their material remains…we try to understand past behaviors by analyzing those artifacts.”</p>
								<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="14" data-line-end="15">Archeologists study humankind specifically and look for clues to investigate past cultures, migrations, populations, human evolution and lifestyles. The field requires both delicate work in excavation as well as the knowhow to interpret scientific findings. Due to this complexity, a lot of training is required. This is where Ohio University’s Field School comes in.</p>
								<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="16" data-line-end="17">“The Field School is an opportunity that we offer to students… typically it’s something that is taken by majors with a focus in archeology,” Gingerich explained. “It’s one of our key courses for job training. We teach methods on how to discover sites, to excavate sites and the general approaches archeologists use to uncover the past.”</p>
								<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="18" data-line-end="19">During the summer, these students have the opportunity to get real experience through a partnership Ohio University has with Wayne National Forest. To an outside observer, it may seem that the program has a lot to do with digging holes.</p>
								<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="20" data-line-end="22">Dr. Andrew Tremayne, the Heritage Program Manager for the Wayne National Forest, describes “shovel-testing,” which is the initial grunt-work students are taught in order to conduct basic surveys. He characterizes these surveys as, “The bread and butter of a lot of archeology jobs.”<br>
								“The goal of shovel testing is to determine if there are any cultural materials that are buried on a site,” he explained. “In Ohio we don’t have a lot of very good surface visibility. Here you have to dig beneath the vegetation to actually find the artifacts.”</p>
								<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="23" data-line-end="24">If one of these tests turn up positive, then more tests are done in the surrounding area to determine whether an excavation would be beneficial to learn more. Sometimes the sites are revisited for a number of field schools. According to Tremayne, “You have to adapt your strategy to learn about the site as you go because you are revealing it as you go.”</p>
								<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="25" data-line-end="26">As for the future of the Ohio Field School’s current site, Tremayne is excited.</p>
								<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="28" data-line-end="29">“There’s a lot more to learn about it,” he said. “Field schools next year and in future years will reveal much more about who was there and what the draw of that place was for them.”</p>
								<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="30" data-line-end="31">With the Field School, students learn not only how to identify sites, but also how to record, excavate and research the sites they work on. This comprehensive approach is part of what sets Ohio’s Field School apart.</p>
								<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="32" data-line-end="33">“Lots of field schools only do excavation,“ Gingerich explained. “There’s just a large portion of field schools that you go to a large, known site and do full-scale excavation… [the Ohio school is] unique because we try to teach all components of archeology.”</p>
								<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="34" data-line-end="35">The work that students complete through the Field School at the Wayne National Forest is valuable not only to their own careers, but also to Ohio University’s Anthropology research, Wayne National Forest and the surrounding public.</p>									<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="36" data-line-end="37">Tremayne expressed, “We, The Wayne National Forest, need assistance and to be able to partner and collaborate with Ohio University. It’s been really huge. It’s beneficial to the Wayne because this collaboration provides us volunteers we need to complete the archaeological investigations. It takes a lot of time and people to investigate archaeology sites. This then allows the Forest Service to share the findings with the public, which is ultimately who we serve.”</p>
								<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="38" data-line-end="39">According to Gingerich, it is most important that Ohio University is able to keep a local presence in archeology.</p>
								<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="40" data-line-end="41">“I think it’s important to know what’s in your own backyard and to provide research experiences nearby so more people can participate,” he said. “Lots of times people think of archeology and they think of Egypt, but… people were running around Ohio hunting mastodons 7,000 years before the pyramids were even built.”</p>

								<section>
									<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="5" data-line-end="6">Meet Douglas Clowe, Ph.D., the current head of the Ohio University Astrophysics Institute. His specialties include gravitational lensing, clusters of galaxies, galaxy evolution, and cosmology. His work with the Bullet Cluster, a collision of galaxy clusters, helped to verify the existence of dark matter.</p>
									<h4 class="code-line" data-line-start=7 data-line-end=8 ><a id="The_Debate_on_Dark_Matter_7"></a>The Debate on Dark Matter</h4>
									<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="8" data-line-end="9">Since the 1930s, scientists have collectively noticed something weird going on with clusters of galaxies. Clowe describes the problem with movement of galaxies in a cluster as being, “Too fast with respect to each other to be held together with just the gravity of the galaxies.”</p>
									<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="10" data-line-end="11">He explains that researchers have developed accurate methods of determining things like the velocity and position of stars, and have also known the approximate mass of stars and “space dust” between them. It is possible to calculate these things by working with the differences, or Doppler shifts, in the emission and absorption spectrum of galaxies, which may change based on the elements in their makeup.</p>
									<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="12" data-line-end="14">However, these numbers had been telling scientists for nearly a hundred years that there was mass missing from their current equation. So the question was: is there missing, undetectable mass, known as “dark matter,” or is the current understanding of how gravity works wrong?<br>
									Super-Heated Soup</p>
									<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="15" data-line-end="16">According to Clowe, the debate was given a jump-start when x-ray was introduced as a new galactic imaging method. With this technology, scientists found that ionized hydrogen and helium atoms superheated at 200 million degrees Kelvin are a part of galaxy clusters. This sounds like something that would melt even the Millenium Falcon, but because these atoms are so far apart and so small, the rate of heat transfer is far too small to have any effect.</p>
									<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="17" data-line-end="18">Though this super-heated soup of atoms may not hinder the future of space travel, it is made up of matter, which has mass. While the mass of a single atom is nearly negligible, an entire galaxy-cluster’s worth of them is not. At first, scientists thought they had answered their question, but really, this cloud only accounted for 10 percent of the missing matter in these systems. So the mystery remained - at least until a few years ago.</p>
									<h4 class="code-line" data-line-start=19 data-line-end=20 ><a id="Light_is_a_Highway_19"></a>Light is a Highway</h4>
									<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="21" data-line-end="22">A key breakthrough happened a few years ago with the observation of two galaxy clusters colliding. Clowe was among the scientists researching this collision known as the Bullet Cluster. In the Bullet Cluster, two galaxy clusters were observed smashing into one another. Clowe explains that the makeup density of the galaxies within the clusters is different than cloud of charged particles that surround them, a collision separates the galaxies from the “soup” they are in. The galaxies will pass right through, because of the sheer enormity of the space between them. The cloud, however, will “lag behind.” This separation gives scientists an opportunity to determine where the majority of mass is concentrated.</p>
									<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="23" data-line-end="24">As explained before, there are two main theories at this point: (1) dark matter and (2) the current understanding of gravity is wrong. Either way, the solution is essentially intended to fix some bad math. Explanation (1) accounts for an unknown mass. Explanation (2) modifies gravity in a way that is outside of general relativity.</p>
									<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="25" data-line-end="27">While bad math might seem like something that stays in college physics classrooms, it is a very real problem that researchers have to account for. Problems are redone hundreds, if not thousands of times, by intellectuals around the world before their results are accepted.<br>
									Scientists already have to correct Newton’s Laws using Einstein’s General Relativity outside of the galaxy. They have to do this because gravity does some weird things to light as it travels through space, making it bend and twist on its way to a destination. The real path of light is much more like an interstate than a plane flight, and some heavy-duty mathematics are needed to straighten it out.</p>
									<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="28" data-line-end="29">Fortunately, this “highway” of light can be used to researchers’ advantage.</p>
									<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="30" data-line-end="31">Using something called Gravitational Lensing to study how light bends in relation to the gravity of other galaxies, scientists like Dr.Clowe can determine where the major source of gravity is coming from. In the case of the bullet cluster, researchers can observe the effect the collision has on the way surrounding galaxies’ light is bent, allowing them to determine where the majority of the mass is located.</p>
									<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="32" data-line-end="33">In theory, dark matter should not interact with the particles that make up the cloud, or “soup.” Since it only interacts with gravity, it should have similar properties to the galaxies within the cluster itself, meaning that if there is dark matter, it will show as a greater mass in the galaxy cluster rather than its cloud. The numbers were run, and the mass was indeed sitting alongside the galaxy cluster rather than the cloud.</p>
									<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="34" data-line-end="35">With this data, Clowe and other researchers were able to confirm that in galaxy clusters, most of the mass must be some form of dark matter.</p>
									<h4 class="code-line" data-line-start=36 data-line-end=37 ><a id="A_Mystery_Remains_36"></a>A Mystery Remains</h4>
									<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="38" data-line-end="39">So what is it? Clowe defines dark matter as a mysterious substance that reacts and affects gravity, but not light. It explains why clusters of galaxies move faster than they should be with respect to one another by filling in a missing mass value in some pretty complicated equations.</p>
									<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="40" data-line-end="41">Clowe gave a few examples of the different theories that are out there:</p>
									<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="42" data-line-end="43">Some scientists theorize that dark matter may be some undiscovered subatomic particle. There are many ongoing experiments where researchers stare at an isolated object, one they know should not be affected by nearly anything but potentially dark matter, and wait for something to happen. While this may sound uneventful, lack of results from these tests are currently ruling out the potential for dark matter to have an interaction with a part of atoms known as the weak nuclear force, and would a reaction ever happen, it could be another revolutionary step in the field.</p>
									<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="44" data-line-end="45">Another theory is that dark matter really just interacts with itself, and has the capability to annihilate itself, releasing something that could link back to its ability to affect gravity. However, Clowe says that if this occurs, “it would probably release energy and other types of particles that do interact with light, so could be detectable as emission lines in X-ray or Gamma-ray parts of the spectrum.”</p>
									<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="46" data-line-end="47">One of the stranger possibilities is related to string theory, which proposes an additional six dimensions in space. Currently, scientists theorize five, which are the three spatial dimensions, time, and one that has to do with the strong and weak forces of atoms. This theory suggests that there are actually two universes that are connected by the sixth dimension, and otherwise don’t interact. The best way to understand this is to think of the universe as a trampoline. When an object is added, the material will stretch to form a pocket for that mass, similar to the way gravity does. Objects of smaller masses will be affected by those indentations. If someone were to sit in the center, and a friend placed a ball on the edge, the way the fabric is stretched would cause the ball to be pulled toward the center. With this theory, the sixth dimension is the fabric of the trampoline, and dark matter would be anything pushing or pulling from the other side, affecting the indentations in the fabric, or gravity in the case of the actual universe.</p>
									<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="48" data-line-end="49">When asked what dark matter is, Clowe replied, “I tell people dark matter can basically be whatever they want it to be, except atoms.”</p>
									<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="50" data-line-end="51">At this point, there hasn’t been a theory proven to be any more valid through experimentation, so all, even the more outlandish theories, are possibilities.</p>
									<h4 class="code-line" data-line-start=52 data-line-end=53 ><a id="The_Quest_for_Knowledge_Continues_52"></a>The Quest for Knowledge Continues</h4>
									<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="54" data-line-end="55">Currently, Clowe is working on improving measurements to reduce errors for an upcoming project known as LSST, or the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope. Today, the best telescopes only survey a tiny portion of the night sky each night. This program aims to change that by using a massive, eight-meter telescope that is designed to capture a sliver of night sky every thirty seconds, giving it the ability to map the entire southern hemisphere in three days.</p>
									<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="56" data-line-end="57">With 10 years of data, scientists will be able to use that data to, as Clowe puts it, “Find things we don’t know exist yet.”</p>
